# Ornament icons

Renders 128x128 build-menu icons for the mod's ornaments in the style of the vanilla Enbesa ornament icons
(`data/ui/2kimages/main/3dicons/ornaments/africa`): same camera, sun from the right, desert sand ground, dark outline.
Plain Node.js, no packages. It needs the extracted vanilla tree on `D:\anno_data\1800` and `C:\tools\` (rdm4-bin, texconv, annotex).

## Use

- `node render_all.js` renders every ornament whose `IconFilename` lies in `data/graphics/icons/ornaments/` into `out/`.
  `out/sheet.png` shows them all.
- `node render_all.js --only palm,tent` renders only those icons.
- `--install` also copies each PNG into the mod and builds its `_0.dds` to `_3.dds` with annotex.
- `node icon.js <modRoot> <cfg> <out.png> [json]` renders one cfg. Options: `{"noGround":true}` draws no sand,
  `{"skipModel":"waterfall"}` drops models by name or file, `{"rotY":90}` rotates the object, and
  `{"pngDecals":true}` draws decals that have no `_0.dds`.

A new ornament is picked up automatically when its `IconFilename` points into `data/graphics/icons/ornaments/`.
The variation shown is the first one, unless `PICK` in `render_all.js` says otherwise.

`VariationIcons` entries under `data/graphics/icons/ornaments/` are rendered too: item i shows variation i. For the
variation the menu icon already shows, the entry reuses the menu icon. The others are named `<icon>_varNN.png`
(NN = variation number from 01). They share the menu icon's `OPTS`.
orientPlace01 (`place`) deliberately has no `VariationIcons` (user, 2026-10-21): its 16 pavings look nearly the same,
so it keeps one icon and the game picks a variation at random.

`{"particles":true}` draws one frame of the cfg's PARTICLE systems (`rdp.js` reads the baked `.rdp`) as soft discs.
The fountain needs it, because its spray is the only difference from the no-spray variation. Full discs cover more than
the sparse particle textures, and the warm tone curve turns water cream, so `look` takes `particleSize`, `particleAlpha`
and `particleTint`.

## How it matches vanilla

These values were fitted by rendering vanilla Africa ornament cfgs and comparing the result with their icons:

- Orthographic camera, elevation 38.5°, azimuth 225°. Geometry from rdm4-bin's glTF is mirrored in x, otherwise the
  vanilla well's pots, bush and beam end up on the wrong side.
- Sun at azimuth 285° and elevation 45° in that mirrored space, so shadows fall to the left. The sun is warm and the
  sky is bluish, with sky occlusion from 24 shadow maps.
- Decal textures run u along +x and v along −z, checked against the Africa fence decals.
- Framing: the visible width is 120 px and the bottom edge sits on row 124. Tall objects are shrunk to fit.
- `tone_lut.json` maps the linear render to the vanilla colours per channel. It came from matching quantiles against
  the vanilla icons. Red clips at about input 100, so the ornament's own decals are first dimmed to the sand's
  brightness. Otherwise bright mosaics come out flat yellow.
- Ground: the 1x1 sand decal `africa_ornaments_1x1_ground_sand_01_diff`, 9-sliced over the `.ifo` BuildBlocker plus 0.05.
- Decals without a `_0.dds` (the 1404 converter's `*_0_0_W_H.png` grounds) are skipped, because the game doesn't load them.
- Water (shader 7 without a texture) is grey-blue. Steep water such as waterfalls is drawn faint.
- Model parts below y = −0.01 are cut off, because the terrain hides them in game. The obelisk mesh, for example,
  sits 4.6 units underground.

`scene.js` loads the cfg tree: MODEL, FILE, PROPCONTAINER/PROP (`.prp`), CLOTH, DECAL and MaterialLODInfos.
`render.js` is the rasteriser. Meshes and textures are cached in `cache/`, which is git-ignored.
